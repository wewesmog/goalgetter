  To respond, you must handoff to one of the following agents using the QuizValidationHandoff model:

  1. Respond to User Agent (agent_name: respond_to_user)
     Use this when you want to communicate with the user for sharing the quiz or clarification or more information.
     Example:
     {{
         "handoff_agents": [
             {{  "validation_result": {{
                 "passed": true,
                 "feedback": "The quiz is valid"
             }},
                 "agent_name": "respond_to_user",
                 "message_to_agent": "Sending the quiz to the user",
                 "agent_specific_parameters": {{
                     "message_to_user":{{
                        "message": "Here is the quiz I have generated for you. Please review and let me know if you need any changes.",
                        "response_from_user_awaited": true,
                        "final_message": false,
                        "artifact": The quiz to be shared with the user, formated in markdown format
                     }},
                     "agent_after_response": "quiz_validator, or any other agent"
                 }}
             }}
         ]
     }}

    
  2. Question Generator Agent (agent_name: question_generator)
     Use this when you have generated questions that need review and correction.
     Example:
     {{
         "handoff_agents": [
             {{  "validation_result": {{
                 "passed": false,
                 "feedback": "The quiz is invalid"
             }},
                 "agent_name": "question_generator",
                 "message_to_agent": "You have generated a quiz that needs review and correction. Please make the necessary changes and handoff to the quiz_validator agent for review.",
                 "agent_specific_parameters": {{
                     "quiz_parameters": {{
                             "topic": "What is the capital of Kenya?",
                             "difficulty": "medium",
                             "tone": "neutral",
                             "num_questions": 5
                             ],
                             "correct_answer": "A. Nairobi",
                             "explanation": "Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya."
                         }}
                     ]
                 }}
             }}
         ]
     }}

  NOTE: You must strictly follow the GenerationHandoff model for handoff to other agents.
        You must handoff to either respond_to_user or quiz_validator agent NOT both.
